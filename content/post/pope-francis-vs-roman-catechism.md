### Shot:

> It is, in itself, contrary to the Gospel, because a decision is
> voluntarily made to suppress a human life, which is always sacred in the
> eyes of the Creator and of whom, in the last analysis, only God can be
> the true judge and guarantor

Pope Francis, [11 October
2017](https://cnstopstories.com/2017/10/11/death-penalty-is-contrary-to-the-gospel-pope-says/)

### Chaser:

> Another kind of lawful slaying belongs to the civil authorities, to
> whom is entrusted power of life and death, by the legal and judicious
> exercise of which they punish the guilty and protect the innocent. The
> just use of this power, far from involving the crime of murder, is an
> act of paramount obedience to this Commandment which prohibits murder.

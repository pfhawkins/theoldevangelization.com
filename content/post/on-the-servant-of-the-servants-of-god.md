"When the Pope uses the title of [_servus servorum Dei_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servant_of_the_servants_of_God), originally
assumed by Pope St. Gregory the Great as a description of the power of
the Supreme Keys, one must remember that the formula _servus servorum_
is not a genitive of object, as if the pope were the one who serves
the servants of God, but an hebraic genitive signifying a superlative
sense as in _saecula saeculorum, virgo virginum, caeli caelorum,_ and
so on. The formula therefore means that the pope is the servant of God
more than all the others, the servent of God _par excellance_, not
that he is the servant of those who are the servants of God. Were it
otherwise, the formula would tend to imply that the pope was the
servant of men rather than of God, and would also imply that only the
pope was not a servant of God, while everyone else was."

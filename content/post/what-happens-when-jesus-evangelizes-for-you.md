There is no low to which our Lord will not stoop in order to win our souls to Him. From _[The Holy Sacrifice of the Mass](https://amzn.to/2oihdVz)_ by Fr. Michael Müller, 1874:

> The Holy Mass may also be called a commemoration of the
Passion and Death of our Lord, because He constantly receives, in this august sacrament, insults similar to those
which He had to undergo in the course of His Passion, and
which He bears in the same manner in which He bore those
that He suffered from Maundy Thursday until He expired
on the Cross.

…

> A poor woman, who had need of money, borrowed a small
sum from a Jewish usurer, giving him in pledge all she
had best in clothes and linen. The feast of Easter approaching, she entreated him to lend her, at least for that great
day, what she had pawned him. “I will willingly do so,”
said he, “ and I will even release you from the whole sum I
lent you, if you promise to bring me the Host you will receive in Communion” The desire of having her clothes
again, and not being obliged to repay the sum borrowed,
proved a temptation which the unhappy woman could not
resist. She promised to bring him the Host, and kept her
promise. On the morrow she went to her parish church,
and after receiving the sacred Host into her mouth, she
hastened to take it out again, wrapped it in a handkerchief,
and brought it to the wretched Jew to whom she had promised it. It was for the purpose of gratifying his hatred
against our Lord that this man wanted to have a Host; he
treated it with the greatest indignity, and Jesus Christ constantly showed him how sensible He was to the outrages
offered Him. The Jew first put the Host upon the table,
and struck it repeatedly with a penknife; blood immediately flowed from it in abundance, which caused the man’s
wife and children to shudder with horror. He nailed it to
a wall and brutally struck it; then he pierced it with a
lance, to renew, if possible, the frightful torments of our
Lord’s Passion. The Host shed blood anew, as though to
prove to the execrable wretch that it was not merely material bread. He threw it into the fire, and it was seen flying
here and there without receiving any injury. The infernal
rage that animated the Jew led him to throw it into a pot
of boiling water; the water took the color of blood, and the
Host then appeared visibly under the form of Christ crucified. This sight so terrified the deicide that he went to hide
himself in a dark corner of his house. But it was not long
before his crime was discovered, and the discovery came
about this wise:

>One of his children, seeing people going to church, cried
out simply : “Do not go to church any more to seek your
God; don’t you know my father killed him?” A woman
hearing what the child said, entered the house under the
pretext of asking for some fire, and she saw the Host, which
was still under the form of Jesus on the Cross; but it soon
resumed its former shape, and came to repose in the little
vessel which the woman had in her hand. All amazed, she
carried her treasure religiously to the church of St. Jean-en-Grève. Information was given to the magistrate. The
Jew, nowise sorry for his fault, was condemned to be burned
alive; **but his wife, his children, and many other Jews were
converted**.

>The house wherein our Lord showed that He is really in
the Blessed Sacrament was changed into a church, and in
course of time it was served by Carmelite monks. The religious who inhabited it were charged with repairing, by a
perpetual adoration, the outrages offered to Jesus Christ in
the sacrament of His love. This sad event took place in
1250.

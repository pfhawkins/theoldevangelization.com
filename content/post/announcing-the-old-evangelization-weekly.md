You may have noticed that not enough blogging happens around these parts. It's not that I don't read a lot of Catholic material, or lack interest in blogging. It's that I tend to write [pieces that require a decent amount of research](https://theoldevangelization.com/pascendi-series/). I just don't seem capable of dashing off short blog posts at the drop of a hat.

But I think I could round up some links and provide some brief commentary on them on a weekly basis. So, without further adieu, I bring you

## [The Old Evangelization Weekly](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/evangelizare)

![St. Paul Writing An Epistle](/images/2016/05/Saint_Paul_Writing_His_Epistles-_by_Valentin_de_Boulogne-1.jpg)

Once a week, every Monday, I intend to bring you just a few links a week on the following topics:

- News & Commentary
- Spiritual Reading
- Catholic Books

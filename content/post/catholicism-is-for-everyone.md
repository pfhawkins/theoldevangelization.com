Jesus came so that all might be saved. Now He never said that all _would_ be saved, or even most. But salvation is at least possible for anyone. 

Nobody knows better than God that different people have different capabilities. Some, like St. Thomas Aquinas, can dictate three different books to scribes at the same sitting and have one of them be considered the best theological treatise of all time. Others like St. Bernadette had little in the way of education. But Jesus made the Catholic faith intelligible to all. No matter a person’s intellect, the basic teachings of the faith can be boiled down to pithy, understandable (yet still deep) statements. Take as an example this early lesson of the [Baltimore Catechism][1]: 

> Q. Why did God make you? 

> A. God made me to know Him, to love Him, and to serve Him in this world, and to be happy with Him for ever in heaven. 

This is a deep topic - the purpose of man - but the basics are stated plainly. 

### Obfuscation Everywhere 

Talking plainly can be difficult. It is easy to say something that unintentionally allows a second meaning. It is almost as easy to twist plain statements into nearly-plain and technically true statements that conceal falsehoods. Such modernist language downplays the truths it doesn’t outright gloss over. 

Since the Second Vatican Council, the Roman Catholic Church has been fraught with documents, homilies, and instructions that, while on one level are certainly true, on another level bring obfuscation, confusion, and openings for the evil one. Plain speaking is found only sporadically. 

With this site, I aim to combat confusing doublespeak, and work out ways to bring the plain truth to those who need to hear it.

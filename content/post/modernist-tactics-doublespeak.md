After writing of the [Modernist Believer](http://theoldevangelization.com/the-modernist-believer/), Pope St. Pius X takes a brief diversion in §18 to discuss a tactic of the Modernists: doublespeak.

> In their writings and addresses they seem not unfrequently to advocate doctrines which are contrary one to the other, so that one would be disposed to regard their attitude as double and doubtful. (§18)

Modernists say one thing at one time, and a contradictory thing at another time. They do this as a consequence of their [false separation of science and faith](http://theoldevangelization.com/the-modernist-believer/). Pius X gives some examples, which I paraphrase here.

1. In a book by a modernist, you might find something completely Catholic on one page, and completely rationalist and unorthodox on the next.
1. When they write history, they don't talk about the divinity of Christ, because the object of science is not the divine. But when they preach from the pulpit, or write a religious work, they teach the divinity of Christ clearly enough. 
1. Again when they write history, they don't resort to the Church Fathers and the Councils of the Church. But “when they catechize the people, they cite them respectfully.”
1. They make a distinction between theological exegesis and scientific exegesis. So their philosophical, historical, and critical works show disdain for Catholic doctrines and the magisterium. And when someone with authority calls them out on this, they claim that their liberty is being violated.
1. They “continuously and openly rebuke the Church” for not submitting her dogmas to the opinions of philosophy. And they come up with a new theology that fits philosophical errors.

## The Practical Effect of Doublespeak

(Here I editorialize, and not just paraphrase what Pope St. Pius X said in *Pascendi* as above.) 

The practical effect of this tergiversation is that it becomes fiendishly difficult for error to be rooted out of the Church. Since a Modernist heretic will proclaim both orthodox and heterodox doctrines at different times and to different audiences, they can appeal to heretics with the heterodox teachings, and hide behind the orthodox ones. 

You will see this effect sometimes in the news. A prelate who has said some questionable things in the past will at some point say something orthodox. The response of many bloggers and commenters is “Ah, this prelate who had me worried must be okay. He said something orthodox! He must be Catholic!”

When a portion of what one says is heretical, one is a manifest heretic. Period. The Church has mechanisms for handling manifest heresy, up to and including excommunication should they prove to be so obstinate in their heresy as to be a formal heretic. But with a majority of the hierarchy themselves modernist, these mechanisms are rarely employed.

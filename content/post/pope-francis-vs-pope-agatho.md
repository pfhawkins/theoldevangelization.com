### Shot:

> â€¦doctrine cannot be preserved without allowing it to develop, nor can it
be tied to an interpretation that is rigid and immutable without
demeaning the working of the Holy Spirit.

Pope Francis, [11 October
2017](http://en.radiovaticana.va/news/2017/10/11/pope_francis_the_dynamic_word_of_god_cannot_be_moth-balled/1342352)

### Chaser:

> nothing of the things appointed ought to be diminished; nothing
changed; nothing added; but they must be preserved both as regards
expression and meaning.

Pope Saint Agatho, as quoted by Pope Gregory XVI in [Mirari

Using contraception to prevent conception is never morally licit. That contracepting is _never_ licit seems to have escaped most commentators on Pope Francis' answer to the Zika question in his latest airplane interview.

Take as a representative example this excerpt from Janet Smith's article "[Contraception, Congo Nuns, Choosing the Lesser Evil, and Conflicting Commandments](http://www.catholicworldreport.com/Item/4594/contraception_congo_nuns_choosing_the_lesser_evil_and_conflict_of_commandments.aspx)":

> **Nuns in the Congo**

>It also confuses many that the officials of the Church many decades ago permitted nuns in the Congo who were in danger of being raped to take hormones that prevent ovulation (which is what the “pill” does). In this case the hormones would be taken with the intent of avoiding a pregnancy, but not a pregnancy that would be the result of a spousal act of sexual intercourse. They would not be altering the purpose of a spousal act of sexual intercourse. Rather, they would be defending themselves against the possible consequences of an act of rape. Keep in mind that it is justifiable for a woman to inflict great physical harm, even death, on a man threatening rape. Her act of killing the rapist is not justified as a “lesser evil” because killing is not a lesser evil than enduring rape. Rather, her act is an act of just and moral self-defense.  

>Thus, for a woman to do something to prevent a rapist’s sperm from uniting with her ovum is a part of justifiable self-defense. Her act has nothing to do with violating God’s plan for sexuality. She is not choosing to use contraception to prevent a spousal act of sexual intercourse from achieving its natural end. She is not refusing to make a complete gift of herself to her spouse.  She is fending off a rapist and all his physicality. Clearly, her use of ovulation-suppressing hormones is not an act of contraception. (A good source for information about the history/reasoning concerning the nuns in the Congo is Fr. Edward Bayer’s Rape Within Marriage (1985), pp. 82-3)

My first thought upon reading this was that Dr. Smith is arguing from [the principle of double effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_double_effect). The principle of double effect allows for someone to take a morally neutral or good action to achieve a good effect, even if that action also produces a foreseeable evil effect (provided that the intended good effect outweighs the bad). I attempted to apply it to the Congo nun example. 

* The action taken to achieve the good effect: taking contraceptive hormones. 
* The good end to be achieved: self-defense from an unwanted baby. 
* The evil effect to be tolerated is… 

Wait a minute, what was that good end again?

> Rather, they would be defending themselves against the possible consequences of an act of rape.

There are two possible physical consequences of an act of rape: sexually transmitted disease, and pregnancy. Contraceptive hormones are not indicated for the prevention of STDs, but are indicated for the prevention and/or elimination of pregnancy. So the action being taken indicates that the "possible consequences of an act of rape" being prevented are babies.

Let that sink in for a minute. The necessary self-defense being argued for here is _from a baby_. Not, I repeat _not_ the rapist. A **baby**. But a baby is not attacking the nun in this scenario; the rapist is. Therefore, the alleged "self-defense" of taking contraceptive hormones is not justified.

## The Purpose of Marriage

Dr. Smith makes much ado about how the sexual act in this example is outside the bounds of marriage:

> Her act has nothing to do with violating God’s plan for sexuality. She is not choosing to use contraception to prevent a spousal act of sexual intercourse from achieving its natural end. She is not refusing to make a complete gift of herself to her spouse.  

She brings this up because up until this point in history, the Church's pronouncements against contraception have been made in the context of pronouncements regarding the sacrament of marriage. These pronouncements have always said that contracepting the conjugal act is intrinsically evil. Since, to her way of thinking, rape is not conjugal, i.e., not within the context of marriage, then the Church's declarations that contracepting is intrinsically evil must not apply. 

Unfortunately for Dr. Smith, this is a good example of the logical fallacy of [denying the antecedent](http://theoldevangelization.com/when-logical-fallacies-attack-denying-the-antecedent/). By saying that the Church's pronouncements in this area are limited to the context of marriage, one cannot logically conclude that contracepting is not intrinsically evil outside of marriage. Other reasoning would be needed to determine whether or not contraception is always and everywhere intrinsically evil. 

Traditionally, fornicators and rapists not only sin by fornicating and raping, but compound their sin by adding artificial contraception into the mix. So while that is not a conclusive argument that contraception is intrinsically evil in all contexts, it is an example of a context outside of marriage where it is evil.

Regardless, this line of reasoning is somewhat moot. Suppose that contraception was permissible in the case of rape. Hormonal contraception, at the low doses almost universally prescribed today, is an abortifacient. It not only can prevent conception, but it can also prevent implantation of an already-conceived fetus. Abortifacients are, in _every_ context, intrinsically evil.

So apologists for the pope's example find themselves in a bind. They end up arguing either that a woman must defend herself from a baby, or that abortifacients are A-OK. Instead, they need to accept that the pope promoted as a positive example something that is intrinsically evil, and against Church teaching. Accepting that fact is the first necessary step toward rectifying the situation.

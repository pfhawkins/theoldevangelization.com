Pope Saint Pius X, in his battle against Modernism, recognized that scholastic philosophy provides a strong basis of defense against Modernism’s attacks on Catholic doctrine. In fact, St. Pius X thought so highly of scholasticism that he decreed:

>We will and strictly ordain that scholastic philosophy be made the basis of the sacred sciences.

>—Pope Saint Pius X,
Pascendi Dominici Gregis §45

Now a papal decree like this is great; yet a decree is of little use if it is not put into practice. And before theologians can put it into practice (that is, make scholastic philosophy the basis of the sacred sciences), they must first share an understanding with the Church of what scholastic philosophy is.

As usual, the Church provides. On 7 March 1916, the Congregation of Sacred Studies published a list of twenty-four fundamental theses of Thomistic thought.

## These Theses Weren’t Built In A Vacuum

In order to understand the importance of these theses, we must first understand the problem which they were intended to confront. Rev. Garrigou-Lagrange, citing J.M.R. Cardinal Villeneuve, identifies that problem as Eclecticism[^1]:

>Thomism is concerned primarily with principles and doctrinal order, wherein lie its unity and its power. Eclecticism, led by a false idea of fraternal charity, seeks to harmonize all systems of philosophy and theology.

>—Rev. Reginald Garrigou-Lagrange,
Reality §54.1

Eclecticism, unlike Thomism, does not attempt to derive philosophical truth from first principles. Instead, it derives truth from majority opinion.

Many authors, hoping to win their ideas more renown, have attempted to shoehorn Aquinas' thought into their own personal opinions. This became so widespread that, at the time the twenty-four theses were published, there was a lot of confusion as to what Aquinas actually taught. In order to tame this confusion, adherents of Eclecticism started saying that all points of doctrine that weren’t unanimously accepted by Catholic philosophers should be considered doubtful.

Since confusion had already caused a large portion of Aquinas' teaching to not be unanimously accepted by Catholic philosophers, this meant that in the eyes of Eclecticism, Aquinas could only be praised for saying what every philosopher of the day believed. J.M.R. Cardinal Villeneuve concludes that

>this process… results in a traditionalism without substance or life, in a practical fideism, a lack of interest in questions of faith. Hence the lack of vigilant reaction against the most improbable novelties.
If we once grant that the criterion of truth, which ought to be intrinsic evidence deriving from first principles, lies instead in external acceptance by a majority, then we condem reason to atrophy, to dullness, to self-abdication. Man learns to get along without mental exertion. He lives on a plane of neutral persuasion, led by public rumor. Reason is looked upon as incapable of finding the truth. We might be inclined to trace this abdication to a laudable humility. But, judged by its fruits, it engenders philosophic skepticism, conscious or unconscious, in an atmosphere ruled by mystic sentimentalism and hollow faith.

>—J.M.R. Cardinal Villeneuve, as quoted in Reality

Keep in mind that Cardinal Villeneuve said the above in 1936. If he thought that there was “an atmosphere ruled by mystic sentimentalism and hollow faith” back then, what might he say about the atmosphere of the present day?

Certainly we live in a time of "a lack of interest in questions of faith". The most improbable novelties, up to and including the Novus Ordo itself, lack "vigilant reaction". Philosophic skepticism abounds.

For these reasons, the Church sought to arm her teachers with a complete natural philosophy.

##The Twenty-Four Theses

Since the criterion of truth is “intrinsic evidence deriving from first principles”, we do well to listen to the Church’s presentation of first principles in these twenty-four theses.

It is important to note that these are not *de fide* teachings. We are not compelled to believe these as articles of the Catholic faith. Instead, they are the Church’s preferred understanding of natural philosophy. It's possible that there are other understandings of philosophy that are true and work well with the Catholic faith, but as of right now this is the best that the Church is aware of.

The theses can be divided into four groupings:

1. Ontology (1 – 7), the science of being
2. Cosmology (8 – 12), the study of the ultimate reasons and universal characteristics of the material universe
3. Psychology (13 – 21), the science of the human soul and its powers and operations
4. Theodicy (22 – 24), the science of natural theology, which studies the existence, attributes, and operations of God

The ordering is exquisite. The theses start with the study of existence, then uses those insights to build a cosmology. We then move on to living bodies, especially human souls, contrasting them with angels, and then progress to an understanding of God Himself.

The goal for this series is to write one post per thesis. I blog this way to goad me into studying, but I hope it will be of some benefit to those who stumble upon it.

[^1]: The observant reader might note that I earlier blamed Modernism, while Cardinal Villeneuve blames Eclecticism. We are not in opposition; Eclecticism is a subset and/or tactic of Modernism.

A follow-up to [the previous post regarding the seventh commandment](https://theoldevangelization.com/the-seventh-commandment-in-the-news/):

“And immediately there came to mind the thief we all have inside ourselves and while I arranged the flowers I took the cross and with just a bit of force I removed it,” Pope Francis said.

The idea to steal a crucifix from a priest's corpse was a temptation. The “thief we all have inside ourselves” is likely a demon tempting its prey, although it is quite possible the temptation was natural and occurred without any demonic prompting. It is certainly impossible to tell which based on a news story like this.

In any event, if something prompts you to perform an objectively evil act, such as stealing, *resist!* Or if the situation calls for it, *flee!* Temptations are to be fought or fled. Do not give in to temptations! Do not blandly accept that we all have a thief inside ourselves! 

Christ came so that we might be victorious against such a tempter. He has showered graces upon us to help us in our fight against temptations. Pray that you might accept those graces and resist or flee any temptation that comes your way.

One of the more striking things I've come across [reading *Pascendi Dominici Gregis*](https://theoldevangelization.com/pascendi-series/) is the tone. Pope St. Pius X writes many words, and he minces not a one of them.

> But we have not yet come to the end of their philosophy, or, to speak more accurately, their folly. (par. 8)

By most measures, that is a sick burn! 

> *Blind* that they are, and *leaders of the blind*, inflated with a boastful science, they have reached that pitch of folly where they pervert the eternal concept of truth and the true nature of the religious sentiment; (par. 13)

Ouch!

For [some reason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modernism_(Roman_Catholicism)), this style of rebuke seems to have fallen out of favor starting in the second half of the 20th Century. I cannot remember reading such harsh language from the pens of Pope John Paul II, Pope Benedict XVI, or Pope Francis.

## The Thing Is, You Can Catch More Flies With Vinegar Than Honey

[No really, you can.](http://xkcd.com/357/)

Did St. Benedict speak sweetly when he [trashed the temple of Apollo](https://theoldevangelization.com/st-benedict-evangelizes/)? From the given accounts, I expect not. Yet he won converts!

What all this boils down to is: Catholicism is true. Period. Sometimes, speaking a plain truth *seems* harsh, but isn't. It offends modern sensibilities to say that modernistic philosophy is more folly than philosophy; but it is true. Saying a modernist perverts the very concept of truth hurts modernist ears; but it is true. And with the grace of God, being challenged by such a hard truth may just be the jolt needed to bring one back to the truth.

## You DO NOT Have License To Be A Jerk

Now just because Jesus flipped the tables of the moneychangers that one time does not give every Catholic a license to be a jerk. Harsh words are not called for in every situation. I as a blogger cannot in good conscience admonish in quite the way that the Pope can. But if we refuse to speak the truth plainly out of a concern for the sensibilities of others, we do violence to the truth, hiding it under a bushel basket. And I'd rather not hide the truth, seeing that Our Lord Jesus Christ is the Truth.

A few months back a friend of mine started a fascinating Facebook page. [Cathedrals: From Era to Era](https://www.facebook.com/CathedralsEra/ "Cathedrals: From Era to Era") chronicles the architectural and design changes to particular American churches in the past century or more. 

![](/images/800px-St._John_the_Evangelist_interior_1912.JPG)Seeing what happened to a beautiful parish like this is a fascinating window into Church in the 20th century.

In order to give these churches a more permanent home on the web, I've invited my friend to start posting write ups [right here on The Old Evangelization](https://theoldevangelization.com/cathedrals "Cathedrals: From Era to Era").

Stay tuned for more church photos, [here](https://theoldevangelization.com/cathedrals "Cathedrals on The Old Evangelization") and on the project's [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/CathedralsEra/ "Cathedrals Facebook") and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CEra2era "Cathedrals Twitter") accounts.

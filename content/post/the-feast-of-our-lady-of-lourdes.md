The eleventh of February is the Feast of the [Apparition of the Immaculate Virgin Mary at Lourdes](http://www.catholictradition.org/Mary/lourdes.htm). Her apparition to St. Bernadette was a great gift to the Church. Without it, we might not recognize Mary as the Immaculate Conception. We must make sure to honor her on this her feast day.

11 February is also the [World Day of Prayer for the Sick](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Day_of_the_Sick). It was instituted by John Paul II in 1992. If we are honest with ourselves, we recognize that it distracts us from celebration of Our Lady's feast. 

It is good to pray for the sick. But do not let your prayer for the sick detract from devotion to Our Lady of Lourdes and the Immaculate Conception.

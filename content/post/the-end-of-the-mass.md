## The Novus Ordo Mass Problem

If you've ever attended a traditional Latin Mass or six, you'll notice many large differences between the Mass of the Roman Rite as she always was, and the Novus Ordo Masses of the last 50 years.

Even if you find a rare Novus Ordo in Latin, chanted to Gregorian tones, replete with bells and incense, the differences are still vast.

All these changes get people wondering: Is the Novus Ordo bad for me?

Some worry… is it even valid?

While not getting too into the weeds on specific changes, I want to dig into the essence of these changes by way of a well-understood philosophical paradox.

(And yes, the Novus Ordo is a valid Mass… but there's more to the matter than just validity.)

## The Ship of Theseus Paradox

The hero-king of Athens, Theseus, returned from Crete on a
wooden ship boasting thirty (count 'em, thirty) oars. The Athenians honored Apollo every
year after by taking his ship to the island of Delos on pilgrimage.
To keep her shipshape, the Athenians replaced planks and other bits of
wood as they rotted.

At some point, some Athenian wondered "if we keep replacing these planks
year after year, is it the same ship?"

This seemingly straightforward question grew into the kind of philosophical paradox that
launches heated bar arguments.

The Ship of Theseus paradox extends the initial question by supposing
that after a century, every single part of the ship has been replaced.
After that century, with 100% different materials, could it really be the
same ship?

Furthermore, what if during that century all the rotting and discarded bits were
kept in a warehouse? If those "leftover" bits were assembled into a ship, would
that second ship be the true ship of Theseus?

## Aristotle To The Rescue

Out of all the proposed resolutions, the one that follows Aristotelian
and Thomistic philosophy is strongest. (Considering Aquinas relied heavily on Aristotle's metaphysics for his philosophy, and then the Church taught that Aquinas's philosophy is the philosophy most in harmony with Catholic theology, I am confident that it is better than the other proposed resolutions.)

In Aristotle's system, everything has a formal or primary end (purpose).
Pope Pius XI uses this concept in his encyclical [_Casti
Connubii_](https://theoldevangelization.com/tags/casti-connubii/) when he states that the primary end of marriage is the begetting and rearing
of children.

Of course, things can also have additional secondary ends, besides the
primary one. In the Casti Connubii example, Pius XI states that the
secondary ends of marriage include the mutual comfort of spouses and the
licit relief of lust.

These distinctions between primary and secondary ends help us sort out what's going on with this boat's identity crisis. The primary end of the ship of Theseus, at least over
that last century, is ferrying pilgrims to and from the island of Delos.
Though its material composition changes, its purpose does not.

That second ship, in the warehouse? While it is materially identical to
the ship of Theseus that returned to Athens from Crete, its formal
end is to be a museum piece. Its material composition is the
same, but its purpose has changed.

## What Does Any Of This Have To Do With The Catholic Mass?

The distinctions between primary and secondary ends, and
how different formal ends entail different identities, helps us make sense of the liturgical reforms made to the Latin Rite before and after Vatican II.

The primary end of the New Mass is the same as that of the Traditional
Latin Mass: glorifying God by means of offering the sacrifice of Christ Himself
to the Father. Both Masses achieve this end.

When someone cries "But the New Mass is valid!", this is what he means. And he is right: the Novus Ordo is a valid Mass.

But those secondary ends... they've undergone as thorough a transformation as a century-old ship of Theseus.

## The Four Ends of the Mass

The [Catechism of Pope Pius X](http://www.santorosario.net/english/mass/3.htm) gives us the four ends of the Mass as follows:

> For what ends is the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass offered?
>
> The Sacrifice of the Mass is offered to God for four ends: (1) To honour Him properly, and hence it is called Latreutical; (2) To thank Him for His favours, and hence it is called Eucharistical; (3) To appease Him, make Him due satisfaction for our sins, and to help the souls in Purgatory, and hence it is called Propitiatory; (4) To obtain all the graces necessary for us, and hence it is called Impetratory.

These are traditionally listed as (1) adoration, (2) thanksgiving, (3) atonement, and (4) petition.

### Adoration

The primary end of the Mass is to glorify God. Adoration, properly honoring God, is the most prominent way we can give God glory in the Mass. In philosophical language, adoration is the proximate end of the Mass. It's the step that comes just before achieving the goal, the step that actually brings about that final result. Adoring and giving God thanks in the Mass is what gets us across the finish line and actually glorifying God.

Again, a valid Mass will always minimally achieve this end by participating in the sacrifice of Calvary, through the transubstantiation of the bread and wine into the body and blood of Christ.

### Thanksgiving

If adoration is the penultimate step before glorifying God, thanksgiving is _a_ penultimate step before adoring him. In thanking God for all the good things He has done for us, we are only giving God what He is due. Plus, humbling ourselves puts us in the right frame of mind for adoration.

### Atonement

Atonement removes obstacles we have to the other ends of the Mass. We cannot effectively glorify, adore, or give thanks to God without having appeased Him and given satisfaction for the punishment due to our sins.

### Petition

Petition, or asking God for good things, helps us get what we need to adore God and give Him glory. We can ask, for example, for graces to help us atone better, to be better at giving thanks, etc. We can ask for graces for others, including health, so that they are in a better position to serve God and save their souls.

## The Problem With The Novus Ordo: It Undermines These Secondary Ends

Having learned of the four ends of the Mass, let's take a look at how the Novus Ordo undermines those ends compared to the Traditional Mass of the Latin Rite.

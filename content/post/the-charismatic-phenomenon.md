Nowadays you can reasonably pigeonhole me as a "traditionalist", but I wasn’t raised one. I had a mainstream-for-the-80's-and-90's Midwest Catholic upbringing. I attended Mass every Sunday, went to Catholic school, served as an altar boy. Went to youth group in high school. 

Part of that mainstream Catholic upbringing entailed being exposed, in high school, to charismaticism. 

I didn't have the word "charismaticism" to call it at the time. I was told that the various phenomena I was seeing were just another aspect of Catholicism. That the exuberant hand-waving, the strange sounds coming out of people’s mouths, the propensity to suddenly fall to the floor like one had turned into a sack of potatoes… all these were things that happened in the early Church, but had fallen by the wayside. But now our youth group had journeyed to Steubenville, a land where the wayside had become the everyday.

Our leaders had prepped us ahead of time: *unusual things might happen. They might not, but they often did. If they happen to you, praise God, but if not, don't worry.* I did my best to take this advice to heart.

Our group settled into a section of bleachers in the campus field house. We were buzzed from the bus ride and the loud Christian pop being pumped over the sound system.

Truth be told, I have some very fond memories of the emotional highs. Each session in the fieldhouse was a wave, or perhaps series of waves; songs and talks and more songs and louder talks breaking into songs, cresting and falling. And as the sessions crested and fell, so did the thrum of each day; and the weekend itself arced up and over and down, with one huge crest on Saturday night.

As far as I could tell that first trip, nothing much unusual happened in the way of charismatic phenomena. Several spoke in tongues, though our group was large enough I didn't witness it directly. One girl did have a vision during Saturday's Eucharistic Adoration, the high crest of the weekend: in it, she saw her brother murdered, spooking her to the core. It seemed out of place compared to the emotional highs the rest of us were enjoying.

That trip to Steubenville was pivotal, for sure. I went from a ho-hum Catholic to a more zealous one. But there was little charismaticism to lean on when I returned home. The enthusiasm that I and so many of my fellow high schoolers had brought home with us quickly faded away. The songs did not sustain us. I found my nourishment in daily Mass, adoration, and reading all the good Catholic literature I could get my hands on. And though not all I read was entirely Catholic, I got my hands on some very good material that made a lasting impression, to the benefit of my soul.

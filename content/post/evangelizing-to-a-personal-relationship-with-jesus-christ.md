FID style evangelization is nice, but ultimately fruitless if we do not have the support system in place at the parish level to help Catholics worship God as He asks of us. (And I'm not talking "ministries" here.) Personal relationship with Christ is not the only relationship; the corporate relationship with Christ of the local Church is also operative.

Dismissing liturgical concerns as esoteric and un-fundamental harms souls.

Does FID teach the traditional teaching of mental prayer?

The primary end of marriage is the procreation and the education of children.

Divorce thwarts that goal. Remarriage thwarts it even more, because the parents are then not in a state of grace.

"But in matrimony provision has been made in the best possible way for this education of children that is so necessary, for, since the parents are bound together by an indissoluble bond, the care and mutual help of each is always at hand." -- Casti Connubii, ยง16

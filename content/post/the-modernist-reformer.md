The last personality of the Modernist is the Reformer. Pope St. Pius X spends only one section on this personality, and it is basically just a list of everything that the Modernists want to reform:

- Philosophy, especially in the seminaries
	- Scholastic philosophy ought to be abandoned as too absolutist, in contrast to modern philosophy which is better suited to the times.
- Theology
	- Rational theology should be based on modern philosophy, and postive theology on the history of dogma.
- History
	- Any history taught must rely on modernist principles discussed earlier.
- Dogmas and their evolution are to be harmonized with science and history.
	- “In the Catechism no dogmas are to be inserted except those that have been reformed and are within the capacity of the people.”
- Worship:
	- The number of external devotions is to be reduced.
    - Steps must be taken to prevent their further increase.
- Church governance:
	- All branches, but especially disciplinary and dogmatic departments, should be made more democratic.
    - “a share in ecclesiastical government should therefore be given to the lower ranks of the clergy and even to the laity and authority which is too much concentrated should be decentralized.”
    - The Roman Congregations and the index and the Holy Office must be modified.
- When engaging with the political world and society, the Church “must adapt itself to them in order to penetrate them with its spirit”
- In the area of morals, the active virtues are more important than the passive, and should be encouraged more.
- Clergy should return to their primitive humility and poverty, and in ideas and action should admit the principles of Modernism.
	- Some desire the suppression of clerical celibacy.
    
If you change all this, what do you have left?

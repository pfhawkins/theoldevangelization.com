I had a discussion with a friend a while ago, after Pope Francis [said some infelicitous things on an airplane](https://theoldevangelization.com/yes-the-pope-said-something-scandalous/). One topic that came up was: how does one use social media responsibly when you are trying to evangelize and there are real issues in the Church right now? Is it at all prudent to highlight the pope's misdeeds? How does one evangelize, yet comment on what's happening without causing mistrust of the pope?

I think that, at least in part, these questions stem from a misunderstanding of the nature of evangelization. There's a popular conception of evangelization these days that reduces it to a repeated proclamation of the *kerygma*. We need to simply proclaim Christ's redeeming love for us in the public square, and leave thornier Catholic teachings for later, in a more private setting. 

This commentary from [Pseudo-Chrysostom](http://www.catecheticsonline.com/CatenaAurea-Matthew4.php) on [Matthew 4:18-22](http://drbo.org/x/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=4&l=18#x), where Jesus calls Simon and Andrew to be apostles, prompted me to revisit this topic:

> The operations of their secular craft were a prophecy of their future dignity. As he who casts his net into the water knows not what fishes he shall take, so the teacher casts the net of the divine word upon the people, not knowing who among them will come to God. Those whom God shall stir abide in his doctrine.

Here we have one of the exemplar Gospel passages on evangelization, and how is evangelization described by a Church Father? “…the teacher casts the net of the divine word upon the people, not knowing who among them will come to God.” 

This seems to present evangelization as preaching Gospel truth to whomsoever will listen, without much regard for the receptivity of the hearer.

Of course, later on in Matthew, in the sermon on the Mount, Jesus tells us:

> Give not that which is holy to dogs; neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest perhaps they trample them under their feet, and turning upon you, they tear you.

Saint Augustine has the following to say about this passage:

> AUG. We must be careful therefore not to explain ought to him who does not receive it; for men the rather seek that which is hidden than that which is opened. He either attacks from ferocity as a dog, or overlooks from stupidity as swine. But it does not follow that if the truth be kept hid, falsehood is uttered. The Lord himself who never spoke falsely, yet sometimes concealed the truth, as in that, I have yet many things to say to you, the which you are not now able to bear; But if any is unable to receive these things because of his filthiness, we must first cleanse him as far as lays in our power either by word or deed. But in that the Lord is found to have said some things which many who heard Him did not receive, but either rejected or contemned them, we are not to think that therein He gave the holy thing to the dogs, or cast His pearls before swine. He gave to those who were able to receive, and who were in the company, whom it was not fit should be neglected for the uncleanness of the rest. And though those who tempted Him might perish in those answers which He gave to them, yet those who could receive them by occasion of these inquiries heard many useful things. He therefore who knows what should be answered ought to make answer, for their sakes at least who might fall into despair should they think that the question proposed is one that cannot be answered. But this only in the case of such matters as pertain to instruction of salvation; of things superfluous or harmful nothing should be said; but it should then be explained for what reason we ought not to make answer in such points to the inquirer.

There's a lot to unpack here.

First, there are definitely times in which you can and should refrain from telling someone a particular truth of the faith. If said someone isn’t receptive, then you’ll only give him ammunition with which to tear you apart. I am reminded of St. Thomas More, at his trial, waiting until the last possible moment to address the question of the king's supremacy in order to avoid unjust conviction and punishment. 

But then there are other times when it is advisable to preach the hard truth to those who need to hear it, even if others present will take scandal by it.

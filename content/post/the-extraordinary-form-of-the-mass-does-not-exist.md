There is no such thing as the extraordinary form of the Mass.

Now Pope Benedict XVI, in his motu proprio [_Summorum
Pontificum_](https://w2.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/letters/2007/documents/hf_ben-xvi_let_20070707_lettera-vescovi.html),
writes:

> In this regard, it must first be said that the Missal published by Paul VI and then republished in two subsequent editions by John Paul II, obviously is and continues to be the normal Form – the _Forma ordinaria_ – of the Eucharistic Liturgy.  The last version of the Missale Romanum prior to the Council, which was published with the authority of Pope John XXIII in 1962 and used during the Council, will now be able to be used as a _Forma extraordinaria_ of the liturgical celebration.  It is not appropriate to speak of these two versions of the Roman Missal as if they were “two Rites”.  Rather, it is a matter of a twofold use of one and the same rite.

Well that seems simple enough, right? According to Benedict, there is one rite, but two forms: ordinary and
extraordinary.

The thing is, that distinction is simply wrong on the face of it.

## Pope Paul VI Calls It A Rite

Pope Paul VI, in a [general audience given 26 November
1969](https://www.ewtn.com/library/PAPALDOC/P6691126.HTM), kicks off his
address with the following:

> We ask you to turn your minds once more to the liturgical innovation of the new rite of the Mass.

That's right: Pope St. Paul VI, the pope who gave us the new rite of the Mass, calls it a new rite.

This should be reason enough to show the Extraordinary
Form/Ordinary Form distinction does not reflect reality. But there are
other reasons as well.

## The Latin Rite Already Has Multiple rites

In the history of the Roman Rite, different Masses within that
Rite have themselves been called rites. For example, the [Dominican rite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominican_Rite),
or the [Ambrosian rite](http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01394a.htm). These "little r" rites have a long and storied
pedigree. In contrast, saying that one rite has multiple _forms_ is an utter novelty.

## Pope Francis Does Not Call It The Extraordinary Form

If the new rite of the Mass is the new rite of the Mass, then it follows
that the old rite would be called the old rite of the Mass, no? Pope
Francis regularly calls the old rite of the Mass exactly that: the
_Vetus Ordo_. Take, for example, this [interview in
_America_](https://www.americamagazine.org/faith/2013/09/30/big-heart-open-god-interview-pope-francis):

> Then there are particular issues, like the liturgy according to the _Vetus Ordo_. I think the decision of Pope Benedict [his decision of July 7, 2007, to allow a wider use of the Tridentine Mass] was prudent and motivated by the desire to help people who have this sensitivity. What is worrying, though, is the risk of the ideologization of the _Vetus Ordo_, its exploitation.

## The EF/OF Distinction Is A Legal Fiction

Now there is a sense in which the extraordinary form exists: as a legal
fiction. This is _de facto_ the purpose it serves in the current
legislation of the Church.

If Pope Benedict XVI had erected it solely as a legal fiction, that
would have been one thing. But instead he used the power of the papacy
to tell a lie: that the Novus Ordo and the Vetus Ordo are the same rite
of the Mass.

They are not.

*Lex orandi, lex credendi* is a Latin maxim roughly translated as "the law of prayer is the law of belief". It has enormous implications.

The way we pray does not just have an impact on what we believe. It dictates what we believe. What Catholics believe comes directly from what Jesus taught the apostles. The apostles spread the faith, because Jesus told them to, by means of preaching and the sacraments. The sacraments are the premier prayers of the Church, crowned by the Most Holy Sacrifice of the Mass, in which we participate in the sacrifice of Christ on Calvary.

Before the New Testament was written and assembled, these prayers were the primary way the Catholic Faith was transmitted. After the New Testament was written and assembled, these prayers **are still** the primary way the Catholic Faith is transmitted. Are you illiterate? No matter: preaching, prayers, and most especially the sacraments will teach you the faith.

## Consequences for the Mass

If the law of prayer is the law of belief, and the Mass is the ultimate prayer, then it stands to reason that the Mass is the ultimate way that the Faith is transmitted.

It also stands to reason that if you change the Mass, you change what the Mass transmits.

Of course some changes, such as adding a feast here or asking for an additional prayer afterwards, do not alter the Faith that the Mass transmits. But after the Second Vatican Council, Pope Paul VI promulgated an entirely new order of the Mass. In so doing, he altered what the Mass teaches.

The Novus Ordo Mass no longer teaches the Catholic faith.

I was doing my normal weekly digging around looking for new content for our [facebook page ](www.facebook.com/cathedralsera) when I came across this parish in Muenster, Texas. It's story intrigued me, and it truly shows the faith and spirit of the Catholic immigrants to the United States.![](/images/69267c0e-64d2-4bf8-88ed-368f3e31ac31_l.jpg)

The community of Muenster, Texas celebrated it's first mass for the Feast of the Immaculate Conception on Dec. 8th, 1889 with twenty-five men, seven women, and six children attending. This marked the official beginning of the German Catholic Town. By January 1, 1890 the residents were ready to prepare for building their church and a school. The school came first and until the church was built this is where they held mass. In 1891, they started the construction of the church, but before it was completed a storm destroyed the building. The people still needed a permanent church building though so they built a second church, this one was a gothic frame building and was completed in the spring of 1892. This church however was not meant to be, it too was destroyed this time by a tornado in 1893. The settlers were determined to practice their faith in a church, their third church was built in 1897. This church was a brick building in the Gothic style, and would serve the parish until 1952.

The determination and faith of the original German Catholic settlers to Muenster is inspirational. Despite the natural forces that seemed to be keeping them away from a church, they persevered. Their hard work brought forth a gorgeous church for them to worship God in the celebration of the Mass. Beautiful.
